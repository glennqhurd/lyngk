# lyngk
An implementation of the game Lyngk for deployment on Richard's PBeM server (www.gamerz.net/pbmserv).

The majority of the files in this project represent the framework provided by Gamerz and the only
edits have been pragmas to reduce compiler warnings.  The game-specific files are those containing
the word "lyngk", e.g.,lyngk_main.cpp.

The file lyngk.html describes the rules and move notation usd by Lyngk.  The LICENSE file gives the
conditions under which Richard Rognlie, the proprietor of Gamerz.net allows use of his base files
and all the same restrictions apply to the new content here.
